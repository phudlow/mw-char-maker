Morrowind character creation simulator built with only React

TODO
1) Add redux (for better state management), then
2) Add react-redux (for better code organization, and to scope components to the state they need to prevent unneeded rerenders)
3) Change redux to react context (to see what its about)

?'s
* Should Result be calculated and put into its own high level state, rather than have the components calcuate the result state from the form state?
